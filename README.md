# OWC Mijn Services

OWC Mijn Services is a WordPress plugin built around custom Gutenberg blocks that integrate with ZGW (Zaakgericht Werken) APIs.
These blocks are the foundation of the plugin, allowing you to easily configure, and display dataâ€”directly within the WordPress block editor.

## Installation

### Manual installation

1. Upload the 'owc-mijn-services' folder in to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. `cd /wp-content/plugins/owc-mijn-services`
3. Run composer install, NPM asset build is in version control already.
4. Activate the plugin in via the WordPress admin.

### Composer installation

1. `composer source git@github.com:OpenWebconcept/plugin-owc-mijn-services.git`
2. `composer require plugin/owc-mijn-services`
3. `cd /wp-content/plugins/owc-mijn-services`
4. Run `composer install`, NPM asset build is in version control already.

### Configure your project

To use this plugin, make sure the following pages exist in your WordPress installation:

- A single page for a Zaak that contains the owc-my-services/zaak block.
- A single page for a Zaak download, no blocks required.
- A page (any type) that contains the owc-my-services/mijn-zaken block.

## Gutenberg blocks

### owc-my-services/zaak

This block displays all data for a single Zaak.
Selecting a ZGW API supplier is the only configuration required in the block settings.

### owc-my-services/mijn-zaken

This block displays an overview of all Zaken, filtered by the selected supplier and the social security number (BSN) of the currently logged-in citizen.

#### Logging

Enable logging to keep track of errors during communication with the ZGW supplier(s).

- Logs are written daily to `owc-my-services-log{-date}.json` in the plugin root directory.
- A rotating file handler keeps up to 7 log files by default, deleting the oldest as needed.
- You can change the maximum number of log files using the filter described below.

## Hooks

### Customizing Template Paths

You can customize the template paths by using the following filter in your theme or another plugin:

```php
add_filter('owcms::view/template-paths', function ($paths) {
    $paths[] = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/resources/views/owc-mijn-services';

    return $paths;
});
```

To prioritize your custom template path over the default ones, use this example:

```php
add_filter('owcms::view/template-paths', function ($paths) {
    $paths[] = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/resources/views/owc-mijn-services';

    return array_reverse($paths);
});
```

### Change the maximum number of log files

Use the following filter to alter the rotating file handler's max files setting:

```php
apply_filters('owcms::logger/rotating_filer_handler_max_files', OWC_MY_SERVICES_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MAX_FILES)
```

### Intercept exceptions for custom handling

You can intercept exceptions caught by the plugin for additional processing or custom logging using this filter:

```php
add_action('owcms::exception/intercept', $exception, $method)
```

The `$exception` parameter contains the caught exception object
